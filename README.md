# walk-with-friends

A full-stack JavaScript and React web app that encourages an active lifestyle by allowing users to create walking routes on a map and share them with friends

[Live Demo](http://walk-with-friends-app.herokuapp.com/)

## Current Feature List
1. User can look up three locations they want to add to a route
2. User can view the mapped route
3. User can view the route details
4. User can view a list of saved routes
5. User can share a walking route with friends
6. User can add a date and time to a saved route
7. User can delete a date from a saved route
8. User can delete a route from their saved routes
9. User can view a list of routes that friends have shared with them
10. User can view a leaderboard of distance walked among their friends in the past week
11. User can add a friend by searching their username
12. User can accept a friend request from another user

## Planned Additions
* User can change their username or password
* User can edit their name
* User can un-share a route
* User can remove a friend

## What I Learned
* Be flexible - must structure the app's features around the data available in the API
* Planning and wireframing are important - designating time to the preparation and design saves hours of time during the coding process
* Implement breakpoints in CSS media queries to ensure mobile responsiveness on a wide range of screen sizes
* Always keep the user and UX as the primary focus when designing the UI
