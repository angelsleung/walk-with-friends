## What I Learned
* Try to think about database design and how the data tables will be organized early on because this will determine how you'll write the fetch requests to the server
* If you're using a third-party API, it pays to thoroughly read and comprehend the documentation on how to properly integrate it into your app
* As a developer, you must consider as many edge cases as possible to make sure the app does not break when it's being used in the real world
* Prepare to spend lots of time testing all the pages with various screen sizes to make sure the app is dynamic and responsive!
